## Makefile backgrounder

1. `make` and `Makefile` ‚Äì Compile **C/C++** programs
1. Always available (_almost_)
1. Comeback in "3 Musketeers" pattern
    - https://3musketeers.io/guide/make.html
1. It's a 3rd of the "3 Musketeers" pattern
1. üÖ≥ üÖ∏ üÖ∞ üÖ≤ ‚Äì üÖ≥ eveloper üÖ∏ nfrastructure üÖ∞ s üÖ≤ ode

**DEMO**

```bash
make
```

_press CTRL-e to execute_

---

## Makefile

- wow it printed something on the screen üëè
- a basic C project: `./01_make_hello_world/`
- Dive in:
  - [ ] tasks,
  - [ ] @command,
  - [ ] tabs,
  - [ ] lazy evaluation (`.Phony`),
  - [ ] `$$`,
  - [ ] different environment (`make env` and `make env-diff-command`)

---

## Make targets
- Standard
    `all`, `build`, `link`, `clean`, `install`, `uninstall`, `rebuild`
- testing and quality
    `test`, `check`, `lint`, `format`
- utility
    `help`, `version`, `run`, `env`, `deps`, `docker`
- packaging and distribution
    `dist`, `release`, `publish`

---

## Why do I care?

- check them out in The Gems
```bash
find ~/.asdf/installs/ruby/3.4.2/lib/ruby/gems -name Makefile
```

_press CTRL-e to execute_

---

## Standard Linux package install

```shell
tar -zxvf package-vXXX.tar.gz
cd package-vXXX
./configure
make
make install
```

---

## Makefile to document your setup

- rails project         - `cd 02_run_a_command`
- ruby project          - `cd 03_file_create`
- conditional setup     - `cd 04_if_not_exist`
- parameters and fail   - `cd 05_fail`
- include Makefiles     - `cd 06_include`

---

## Makefile Examples

- https://github.com/failure-driven/experimental-methods-in-sidekiq/blob/main/Makefile

## Makefile everywhere

- available everywhere (_almost_) just like `vi`, `awk`, `sed`, `grep`, etc

```shell
docker run -it --rm alpine /bin/ash
which sed && which awk && which grep

# vi

apk add --no-cache make
make --version

apk add --no-cache just
just --version
```

---

## Makefile

- good way to document scripts per repository

---

## Just

- `just` is a handy way to save and run project-specific commands.
- https://just.systems/man/en/
    - https://github.com/casey/just

---

## Just examples

- switch to just        - `cd 07_switch_to_just`

---

## Just quirks

- not everywhere

```yaml
# GitHub actions
name: Continous Integration

jobs:
  thing:
    name: The thing I want to run

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Just
        uses: extractions/setup-just@v2
```

---

## Just quirks cont.

```ruby
# just file for managing this repo

#   - https://github.com/casey/just
#   - https://just.systems/man/en/

# use bash which is required for GHActions. To overrid locally to make things
# like colors work with most Mac OS you may need following overrides:
#       alias just="just --shell zsh"
# or always call
#       just --shell zsh
set shell := ["bash", "-uc"]
```

---

## Mise new kid on the block

- relies on `.tool-versions` (no need for ASDF, rvm, rbenv, etc)
- multithreaded
- tasks from directory `./mise-tasks/<name>.rb`
- nice (chmod for you, menus, passes -options, polished)
- cons - (turn off?, install the world)
- more info [https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/)

---

## xc run your documentation

- controlled by `## Tasks` heading
- not as polished
- run your documentation
- but a higher level of abstraction
- more info [https://xcfile.dev/getting-started/](
  https://xcfile.dev/getting-started/)

---

## Other tools

- npm
- Rakefile

---

## Why script?

## In Review

- don't rely on cobbelled together developer setup!!!
- `bash` and `make` are your friends
- extend through `Brew`, `Just`, `ASDF`, `mise`
- watch out for new tools like `xc`
