# Make🔧 Just⚖️ development task runners

Developer Experience (DX) on a local machine is still very much based on
**manual** playbooks of Unix commands, Developer specific tool commands and
"click ops" (_manual and usually mouse (click🐁) based installation_). Often
switching to a task runner can lift the DX to a new level. This repo is an
overview of 4 such tools:

- Makefile `make` - https://www.gnu.org/software/make/
- Justfile `just` - https://just.systems/man/en/
- mise - https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/
- xc - https://xcfile.dev/

## get started

```sh
make
make present
# OR
just
just present
# OR mise
# OR xc
```
